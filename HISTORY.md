| --- | --- |
| 0.1 to 0.3 | initial code with code efficiency improvements (cf. ISBI paper, 2010) |
| 0.4 | added implementation for the sinusoidal sensitivity model, the experiments of the ISBI paper are reproduced with that model. |
| 0.5 |	added GUI to generate phantom composed of ellipses, polygons and quadratic Bezier curves, the rasterization of such phantoms is supported. |
| 0.6 | added SVG and PDF export for the phantom. |
| 0.7 | added support for polygon and Bezier curves is yet to be added (cf. Laurent Lejeune's project). |
